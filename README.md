The goal of the project was to create a program that helps manage and display college courses. It needed to load course data from a file, store it efficiently, and allow users to search for courses or view all courses in order.
I started by understanding what the program needed to do — store and organize course information, then let users search and view that information. I chose to use a Binary Search Tree (BST) because it keeps data sorted and makes searching faster. Learning about different data structures helped me pick the one that best fit the needs of the program.
One issue I ran into was using the wrong variable names, which caused errors in the program. I fixed it by going through the code carefully and making sure everything matched. I also added checks to handle bad or missing data in the file so that the program wouldn’t crash.
This project helped me understand the importance of selecting the right tools and maintaining organization. I learned to split my code into smaller parts, so each section handles one job. That made it easier to test and update the code.
Now I focus more on writing clean and easy-to-read code. I use clear names, add comments, and try to make my code flexible so it’s easier to change later. I’ve learned that good code isn’t just about working — it should also be easy to understand and update.
